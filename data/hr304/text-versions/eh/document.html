                demonstrating it is authorized to conduct such activity 
                under the laws of each State in which the agency 
                practices; and

                if the Attorney General determines that the issuance of 
                such registration would be inconsistent with the 
                requirements of this subsection or the public interest 
                based on the factors listed in subsection (f).
            ``(2) Option for single registration.--In registering an 
        emergency medical services agency pursuant to paragraph (1), 
        the Attorney General shall allow such agency the option of a

        registration for each location of the emergency medical 
        services agency.
            ``(3) Hospital-based agency.--If a hospital-based emergency
