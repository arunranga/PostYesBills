   To amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of 
   Veterans Affairs to adopt and implement a standard identification 
protocol for use in the tracking and procurement of biological implants 
     by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Biological Implant Tracking and 
Veteran Safety Act of 2017''.

SEC. 2. IDENTIFICATION AND TRACKING OF BIOLOGICAL IMPLANTS USED IN 
              DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL FACILITIES.

    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 73 of title 38, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 7330C. Identification and tracking of biological implants
    ``(a) Standard Identification System for Biological Implants.--(1) 
The Secretary shall adopt the unique device identification system 
developed for medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration under 
section 519(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
360i(f)), or implement a comparable standard identification system, for 
use in identifying biological implants intended for use in medical 
procedures conducted in medical facilities of the Department.
    ``(2) In adopting or implementing a standard identification system 
for biological implants under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall permit 
a vendor to use any of the accredited entities identified by the Food 
and Drug Administration as an issuing agency pursuant to section 
830.100 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor 
regulation.
    ``(b) Biological Implant Tracking System.--(1) The Secretary shall 
implement a system for tracking the biological implants described in 
subsection (a) from human donor or animal source to implantation.
    ``(2) The tracking system implemented under paragraph (1) shall be 
compatible with the identification system adopted or implemented under 
subsection (a).
    ``(3) The Secretary shall implement inventory controls compatible 
with the tracking system implemented under paragraph (1) so that all 
patients who have received, in a medical facility of the Department, a 
biological implant subject to a recall can be notified of the recall 
if, based on the evaluation by appropriate medical personnel of the 
Department of the risks and benefits, the Secretary determines such 
notification is appropriate.
    ``(c) Consistency With Food and Drug Administration Regulations.--
To the extent that a conflict arises between this section and a 
provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et 
seq.) or section 351 or 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.

the provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or Public 
Health Service Act (including any regulations issued under such 
provisions) shall apply.
    ``(d) Biological Implant Defined.--In this section, the term 
`biological implant' means any human cell, tissue, or cellular or 
tissue-based product or animal product--
            ``(1) under the meaning given the term `human cells, 
        tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products' in section 
        1271.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, or any 
        successor regulation; or
