# PostYesBills
This is the PostYesBills code repository as part of DebugPolitics.
Our MVP will consist of ways to:
  View bills before Congress, from both House and Senate.
  View a "hot bill" or Call To Action bill, which induces the PYBiller to read, annotate, or comment.
  View an editorialized summary of a bill.
